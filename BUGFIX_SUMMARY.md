# Bug Fix Summary - Advanced OCR with Dropdown

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **AttributeError: 'TesseractOCREngine' object has no attribute 'extract_with_best_config'**

**Problem:** 
- The new dropdown version was calling a non-existent method `extract_with_best_config()`
- The actual method in `TesseractOCREngine` class is `extract_text()`

**Solution:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG (was causing error)
best_ocr = ocr_engine.extract_with_best_config(image)

# ✅ FIXED
ocr_results = ocr_engine.extract_text(image)
best_ocr = ocr_results[0]  # Get best result from list
```

### 2. **Method Name Mismatch: 'detect_language_comprehensive'**

**Problem:**
- Called non-existent method `detect_language_comprehensive()`
- The actual method is `detect_language()`

**Solution:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG
detected_lang, confidence, all_scores = detector.detect_language_comprehensive(raw_text)

# ✅ FIXED  
detected_lang, confidence, all_scores = detector.detect_language(raw_text)
```
