```

### 2. 💬 **Line-by-Line Comments Tab**
```
💬 Educational Line-by-Line Documentation
Documented by: codellama:13b
Language: PYTHON

# Import the sys module for system-specific parameters
import sys
# Define a function to calculate fibonacci numbers recursively
def fibonacci(n):
    # Check if the input is a base case (0 or 1)
    if n <= 1:
        # Return n for base cases
        return n
    # Calculate fibonacci recursively for non-base cases
    else:
        # Return sum of two previous fibonacci numbers
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

### 3. 🔧 **Cleaned Code Tab**
```
🔧 Cleaned Code
Processed by: codellama:13b
